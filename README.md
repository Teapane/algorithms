Algorithms
==========
This is a small collection of algorithms I have written in Ruby and tested with Minitest.  I hope that this repository will continue to grow. 
**Binary Search Tree** 

  A node based search tree with the following properties: 
  
    * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    
    * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    
    * The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
    
    * There must be no duplicate nodes.
    
  This test suite originates from Exercism.io[http://exercism.io]

**Linked List**

  A Linked List is a data structure consiting of a group of nodes, which together represent a sequence.  
  In order to make a linked list, I needed to: 
  
    *  Create a Node class
    
    *  Creating a Linked List class that utilizes the Node class. 
    
  This test suite originates from an exercise we did in class here at gSchool by Jumpstart Lab. 

**Prime Factors**
  The Prime Factors of a positive integer are the prime number that divide the integer exactly.

**Algorithms I have started but haven't finished**
**A star
**Merge Sort
**Ternary Search

These exercises are important to me because I feel like sometimes I get caught up in web development and this is an attempt to practice some concrete computer science concepts.
