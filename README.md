algorithms
==========
This is a collection of algorithms I have tested and written in Ruby, mainly using Minitest.  

**Binary Search Tree** 

**Linked List**

**Prime Factors**

Most of the test suites originated from [exercism.io], with slight modifications by me to make them more precise. 

These exercises are important to me because I feel like sometimes I get caught up in web development and this is an attempt to practice some concrete computer science concepts.
